## Who am I?

Hello!
My name is `Jake Vaughn` and I'm a college graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU).

## Professional Experience

Ever since the pandemic I have been working freelance, and self-employed in the web3 blockchain space. In a not so structured manner, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from Ethereum Mining to Arbitrage Bots to setting up RPC/WSS API nodes on a number of chains. I have set up and hosted EVM nodes on ethereum, polygon, moonbeam, moonriver, polkadot, and many others. I have also been paid to create and work on dapps such as dexes, nft platforms, proxy contracts, and token deployers using Remix, Hardhat, Solidity, NodeJS, and Typescript. I mainly focus me energy on smartcontract bytecode deployment, security and optimization. I also enjoy working on backend integration with RPC and WSS APIs. A lot of if not all of everything I use I had to learn from scratch using documentation and experimentation.

## Educational Experience

I graduated from Iowa State University with a four year Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering in May of 2021 (in the midst of the pandemic). During my time in college I learned how to program in languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, vhdl and Verilog. I worked of a number of projects and labs gaining a wide range of skills from creating low pass filters on electrical engineering breadboards to working with operating systems, process and thread scheduling, deadlocks, and memory management. In our degree we are given the choice of focus areas with specific class requirements for completing them. The areas I focused on were Embedded Systems, VLSI, and Cyber Security.

## Career Objectives

My current goals are establishing myself in a professional career preferably one that allows me to learn, grow, and work on a number of projects to gain experience. I can currently see myself going down a number of paths with a focus on building tools and projects for the future. The ultimate goal for me is working on systems and projects that are impactful to the world while utilizing years of accumulated knowledge to take on big problems.
