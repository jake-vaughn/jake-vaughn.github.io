## Who am I?

Hello!
My name is `Jake Vaughn` and I'm a college graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU).

## Professional Experience

Since the beginning of the 2020, I have been working self-employed in the web3 blockchain space. I have a diverse range of experience, including Ethereum mining, arbitrage bots, and setting up RPC/WSS API nodes on multiple blockchain networks. I have set up and hosted EVM nodes on networks such as Ethereum, Polygon, Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Polkadot. I have also been paid to create and work on decentralized applications (dApps) such as decentralized exchanges (DEXes), non-fungible token (NFT) platforms, proxy contracts, and token deployers using languages and tools like Remix, Hardhat, Solidity, NodeJS, and Typescript. My main focus is on smart contract bytecode deployment, security, and optimization. I also enjoy working on backend integration with RPC and WSS APIs. I have learned everything I know through self-education and experimentation, using online documentation and other resources.

## Educational Experience

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Iowa State University in May 2021. While in college, I learned how to program in languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, VHDL, and Verilog. I completed various projects and labs, gaining skills in electrical engineering, operating systems, process and thread scheduling, and memory management, among other areas. In my degree program, I chose to focus on Embedded Systems, VLSI, and Cyber Security, which required me to complete specific coursework in order to graduate.

## Career Objectives

My current goals are to establish myself in a professional career that allows me to learn, grow, and gain experience through working on a diverse range of projects. I am open to exploring different career paths, with a focus on building tools and projects for the future. Ultimately, my goal is to use my knowledge and skills to work on systems and projects that have a positive impact on the world and tackle complex challenges.
