## Who am I?

Hello!
My name is `Jake Vaughn` and I'm a college graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU).

## Professional Experience

Since the beginning of 2020, I have been working in the web3 blockchain space as a self-employed individual. My work has included a variety of activities, such as mining Ethereum, creating arbitrage/mev bots, and setting up RPC/WSS API endpoints on multiple blockchain networks. I have also set up and managed blockchain full nodes on networks like Ethereum, Polygon, xDai, Moonbeam, and Polkadot. Additionally, I have developed decentralized applications (dApps) such as decentralized exchanges (DEXes), proxy contracts, and token deployers using tools like Remix, Hardhat, Solidity, NodeJS, and Typescript. My main focus is on smart contract bytecode deployment, security, and optimization, as well as backend integration with RPC and WSS APIs. I have learned all of these skills through self-education and experimentation, using online resources and documentation.

## Educational Experience

As a computer engineer, I have had the opportunity to learn and develop a wide range of technical and non-technical skills. I have studied programming languages such as C, C++, and Java, and have used these skills to design and implement complex software systems. I have also gained expertise in computer architecture and networking, which has helped me understand the underlying systems that support modern computing.

In addition to my technical skills, I have also had the opportunity to develop important non-technical skills, such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. These skills have been valuable in my work as a computer engineer, as they have allowed me to collaborate effectively with other team members and tackle complex projects.

Overall, my educational experience as a computer engineer has been incredibly rewarding, and has provided me with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in this field. I am excited to continue learning and growing as a computer engineer, and to apply my skills to help solve some of the world's most challenging problems.

## Career Objectives

My current goals are to establish myself in a professional career that allows me to learn, grow, and gain experience through working on a diverse range of projects. I am open to exploring different career paths, with a focus on building tools and projects for the future. Ultimately, my goal is to use my knowledge and skills to work on systems and projects that have a positive impact on the world and tackle complex challenges.
