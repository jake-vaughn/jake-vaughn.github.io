So I want to make this post to get my current point of view on GPT on paper, computer, uh bits I don't know. As of this moment I have a batchlors in computer engineering with work selfemployed as a software developer. I believe that over the coming months GPT will become relitivly contritial for people with different backgrounds. The opinons in this post are my own from my knowledge and history and may not be what I will always believe. With that out of the way lets get into it.

For me GPT is the best thing since sliced bread, something that I didn't know I needed, the plow to agriculture, insert any random cliche here. GPT heavily helps me in convey information from my head and into text in a way that allows others to understand.

For me I have always had difficulty with writing. Context order, grammar, spelling, flow none of it has come easy to me and even though I have gone through many high level english classes I have never been able to write at a capacity that can portray my knowledge accurately.

In my mind GPT in the last 3 days has become a tool that I could not live without. It is like a calculator for english... no scratch that it is a calculator for any language. It can write better than I can, portray information better than I can, and describe and recall detail better than I can. In times where I can't come up with an idea of how to write something GPT can provide inspiration and examples for me so I can continue. If my paragraphs don't flow properly GPT can fix it. GPT is so powerful and those examples don't even come close to the capabilities of GPT.

GPT makes me want to do something that I have spent so much time in my life dreading and trying to avoid. Writing, revising, editing has become a incredibly enjoyable task. It has opened a creative door in my mind that I didn't even know was closed. Using prompts generated by me I can easily create text like never before. No longer do I have to worry if I am writing something the right way I can purely convey information. GPT makes me want to go back to highschool and take all of my college classes over again. This is not only due to the ease at which I could get work done but also the quality of my work would shoot way up while also getting the points and information I wanted to get across quicker.

This leads me into the next line of thought which is the misuse of GPT. If I went back to school would I end of using GPT write things that I didn't know and never learned. The answer to that would most likely be yes. Which brings up the negative side of GPT which is its potential to skip understanding. In GPTs current form it still requires a decent amount of knowledge from the prompt giver to create optimal output. In the future it may become even better leading to some clear problems.

Yet the one thing that I keep continuously hearing in my mind is "no calculators allowed! What do you expect to have a calculator in your pocket at all times in the future?" which is a statement I often heard growing up. Fast forward to today everyone has a calculator in their pocket and being able to do long division in your head is more of a party trick than an actual skill. Now don't get me wrong I do believe learning these skills is important to understanding more and more complex topics, but outside of academics and in the real world having the most efficient method of doing things is what leads to success. In the same way that once we learned a topic we would then learn how to use a calculator to do it for us I believe GPT or its evolution will become an important tool to being as productive as possible. Learning how to use GPT will become essential to keeping up in the real world.

My favorite part of GPT is that it can be heavily influenced by the input given to it tailoring it to the user while expanding on topics and detail in a way that makes the purpose of the writing clear. Additionally I believe it can be a great tool for learning as it can give instant feedback to questions, revising of writing, and much more. I am incredibly impressed by GPT and I believe everyone else is too as the site is almost always overloaded.

Importantly I believe GPT could be a pivotal problem as it comes to centralization, ad targeting, privacy, and data. If you can imagine in the future a personalized version of GPT that you train with your history, knowledge, questions, papers, emails, text messages, and thoughts. If hosted by a third party would be a huge invasion into any sense of privacy. It would put the amazon alexa always listening device controversy to shame. It has only been 3 days and openAI's databases already know that I am a size 31 waste. If it came to using a personal assistant with these capabilities I believe it would be no question for a lot of people myself included to use it. This would put a lot of control in a few peoples hands most likely leading to major problems later down the line. "Hopefully by that time I will be too old and it won't be my problem." wow I'm getting old.

Back to the happy side of GPT. It will make everything easier and quicker. Automating tedious tasks, collecting information, and enabling more free time to do things that we want to do. For example this is the output if I ask GPT for a MLA format for the land before time.

Here is an example of an MLA format for "The Land Before Time" as a source:

Title of Work: The Land Before Time

Director: Don Bluth

Producer: Steven Spielberg

Release Date: November 18, 1988

Medium: Film

Publisher: Universal Pictures

Date of Access: [include if you watched the film online or accessed it through a database]

In-text citation: (Bluth)

Works Cited:

Bluth, Don. The Land Before Time. Universal Pictures, 1988.

It is able to obtain everything in seconds and format it appropriately while also giving me hints, in-text citations and what to put in my works cited. This is something that would normally take me at least several minutes and a search of the MLA format online for the four thousandth time.
